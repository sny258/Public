v3.3  --  sanjay (copy deleteAgentByName.ps1/start.ps1/start-deleteAgents.ps1 to container)
# start-deleteAgents.ps1 will delete the offline agents (if any) then create and register the agent at startup.
# deleteAgentByName.ps1 will execute at preStop to delete the agent (online, using pod name) before pod dies.


v3.4  --  sanjay (same as 3.3 just need to run agent for 1 job i.e. run.cmd --once in start-deleteAgents.ps1 file)
# This will be used only for for KEDA ScaledJob
# since agent is running for one job only, it will remove the agent from pool also after that (finally block will get executed)


v3.5  --  sanjay (it is for KEDA, only start.ps1 required with .\run.cmd --once so that no cleaning happens of offline agents in agent pool) 
# dockerfile will run start.ps1 at run time (CMD ["powershell.exe", "-File", "start.ps1"])
