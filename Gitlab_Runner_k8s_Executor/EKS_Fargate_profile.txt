*** EKS Fargate Profile ***

1. Instead of running pods on node groups, we can run the pods on EKS fargate profile.
2. This way there is no need to manage the nodegroups, AWS will host pods on fargate nodes (serverless).
3. Fargate cost: https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/pricing/


Steps
------

1. Create an IAM role for fargate profile and update the trust policy.
   Role: AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRole
   Policies: AmazonEKSFargatePodExecutionRolePolicy, AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
   Trust Policy:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "eks-fargate-pods.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:eks:eu-central-1:049618110064:fargateprofile/gwl-gitlab-runner-eu-central-1-eks-external/*"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

2. Now create a Fargate profile in cluster, provide subnets, namespace and pod labels. pod labels are the ones which will schedule the pods on the fargate nodes. 

3. The comute capacity mentioned for the pods in deployment will be the one fargate take as reference for selecting the nodes to schedule and host the pods.
